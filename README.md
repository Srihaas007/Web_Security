# Cybersecurity Project: Enhancing Security of website

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive cybersecurity initiative aimed at enhancing the security posture of website. It encompasses a range of security measures and best practices to mitigate risks, safeguard sensitive data, and protect against cyber threats.

## Key Features and Security Measures Implemented

### 1. CSRF Tokenization

- **Description:** Implemented CSRF tokenization to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Risks:** Without proper CSRF protection, attackers could forge requests on behalf of authenticated users, leading to unauthorized actions.
- **Mitigation:** Generated unique tokens for each user session and validated them on the server, ensuring that only legitimate requests from authenticated users were processed.

### 2. Distinct User Roles and Access Control

- **Description:** Implemented role-based access control to differentiate between user roles (e.g., customer, seller, administrator) and enforce appropriate access permissions.
- **Risks:** Without proper access control, unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive functionalities and data.
- **Mitigation:** Assigned specific permissions to each user role, ensuring that users could only access functionalities relevant to their role.

### 3. Secure Review Submission

- **Description:** Implemented rigorous file type and size checks to prevent the upload of malicious files during review submission. Utilized content sanitization to mitigate risks associated with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Risks:** Without proper file validation and content sanitization, attackers could upload malicious files or inject malicious scripts into the application.
- **Mitigation:** Implemented file type and size checks to restrict uploads to safe file formats and sizes. Utilized content sanitization techniques to escape user inputs, preventing XSS attacks.

### 4. User Account Management

- **Description:** Enhanced security in user account management by utilizing bcrypt for password hashing and enforcing strong password policies.
- **Risks:** Weak password management practices could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and compromise sensitive data.
- **Mitigation:** Hashed user passwords using bcrypt to protect them from brute force attacks. Enforced strong password policies to ensure that user credentials met stringent security criteria.

### 5. Admin Account Capabilities

- **Description:** Secured administrative functionalities with measures to prevent unauthorized access. Employed parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks.
- **Risks:** Without proper security measures, administrative functionalities could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform malicious actions.
- **Mitigation:** Implemented measures to prevent unauthorized access to administrative functionalities. Utilized parameterized queries to sanitize user inputs and prevent SQL Injection attacks.

## Risks and Vulnerabilities Mitigated

- **CSRF Attacks:** Prevented CSRF attacks by implementing CSRF tokenization, ensuring that only legitimate requests from authenticated users were processed.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Mitigated the risk of unauthorized access by implementing role-based access control and enforcing appropriate access permissions for each user role.
- **Malicious File Uploads:** Prevented the upload of malicious files by implementing rigorous file type and size checks and restricting uploads to safe file formats and sizes.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:** Mitigated the risk of XSS attacks by utilizing content sanitization techniques to escape user inputs and prevent the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weak Password Management:** Enhanced security in user account management by utilizing bcrypt for password hashing and enforcing strong password policies, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **SQL Injection Attacks:** Secured administrative functionalities by employing parameterized queries to sanitize user inputs and prevent SQL Injection attacks, ensuring the integrity of database interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language used for backend development.
- **Flask:** Micro web framework used for building the web application.
- **bcrypt:** Library used for password hashing.
- **MarkupSafe:** Library used for content sanitization.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Frontend technologies used for user interface development.
